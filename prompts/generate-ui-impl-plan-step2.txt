You are an AI assistant whose task is to summarize a conversation about UI architecture planning for an MVP and prepare a concise summary for the next stage of development. In the conversation history, you will find the following information:
1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. Information about the technology stack
3. API plan
4. Conversation history containing questions and answers
5. UI architecture recommendations

Your task is to:
1. Summarize the conversation history, focusing on all decisions related to UI architecture planning.
2. Match the model's recommendations to the answers given in the conversation history. Identify which recommendations are relevant based on the discussion.
3. Prepare a detailed summary of the conversation, which includes:
   a. Main requirements for UI architecture
   b. Key views, screens, and user flows
   c. Strategy for API integration and state management
   d. Issues regarding responsiveness, accessibility, and security
   e. Any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification
4. Format the results as follows:

<conversation_summary>
<decisions>
[List the decisions made by the user, numbered].
</decisions>
<matched_recommendations>
[List the most relevant recommendations matched to the conversation, numbered]
</matched_recommendations>
<ui_architecture_planning_summary>
[Provide a detailed summary of the conversation, including the elements listed in step 3].
</ui_architecture_planning_summary>
<unresolved_issues>
[List any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification, if any]
</unresolved_issues>
</conversation_summary>

The final result should contain only the content in markdown format. Ensure that your summary is clear, concise, and provides valuable information for the next stage of UI architecture planning and API integration.
