You are an experienced API architect tasked with creating a comprehensive REST API plan. Your plan will be based on the provided database schema, Product Requirements Document (PRD), and the technology stack mentioned above. Carefully review the input data and complete the following steps:

1. Analyze the database schema:
   - Identify the main entities (tables)
   - Note the relationships between entities
   - Consider any indexes that may affect the API design
   - Pay attention to validation conditions specified in the schema

2. Analyze the PRD:
   - Identify key features and functionalities
   - Pay attention to specific requirements for data operations (retrieval, creation, update, deletion)
   - Identify business logic requirements that go beyond CRUD operations

3. Consider the technology stack:
   - Ensure the API plan is compatible with the specified technologies
   - Consider how these technologies might influence the API design

4. Create a comprehensive REST API plan:
   - Define the main resources based on database entities and PRD requirements
   - Design CRUD endpoints for each resource
   - Design endpoints for business logic described in the PRD
   - Include pagination, filtering, and sorting for list endpoints
   - Plan appropriate use of HTTP methods
   - Define request and response payload structures
   - Include authentication and authorization mechanisms if mentioned in the PRD
   - Consider rate limiting and other security measures

Before delivering the final plan, work inside <api_analysis> tags in your thinking block to break down your thought process and ensure you've considered all necessary aspects. In this section:

1. List the main entities from the database schema. Number each entity and quote the relevant part of the schema.
2. List the key business logic functions from the PRD. Number each function and quote the relevant part of the PRD.
3. Map the functions from the PRD to potential API endpoints. For each function, consider at least two possible endpoint designs and explain which one you chose and why.
4. Consider and list any security and performance requirements. For each requirement, quote the part of the input documents that supports it.
5. Clearly map business logic from the PRD to API endpoints.
6. Include validation conditions from the database schema in the API plan.

This section can be quite lengthy.

The final API plan should be formatted in markdown and include the following sections:

```markdown
# REST API Plan

## 1. Resources
- List each major resource and its corresponding database table

## 2. Endpoints
For each resource, provide:
- HTTP Method
- URL Path
- Brief description
- Query parameters (if applicable)
- Request JSON payload structure (if applicable)
- Response JSON payload structure
- Success codes and messages
- Error codes and messages

## 3. Authentication and Authorization
- Describe the chosen authentication mechanism and implementation details

## 4. Validation and Business Logic
- List validation conditions for each resource
- Describe how business logic is implemented in the API
```

Make sure your plan is comprehensive, well-structured, and addresses all aspects of the input materials. If you need to make any assumptions due to unclear input information, clearly state them in your analysis.

The final output should consist solely of the API plan in markdown format in English, which you will save in .ai/api-plan.md and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the thinking block.
