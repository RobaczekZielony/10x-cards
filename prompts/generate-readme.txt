You are an experienced developer tasked with creating a README.md file for a GitHub project. Your goal is to produce a comprehensive, well-structured README that follows best practices and includes all relevant information from the provided project files.

Here are the project files to analyze:

<prd>
@prd.md
</prd>

<tech_stack>
@tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

<dependencies>
@package.json
@.nvmrc
</dependencies>

Your task is to create a README.md file with the following structure:

1. Project name
2. Project description
3. Tech stack
4. Getting started locally
5. Available scripts
6. Project scope
7. Project status
8. License

Instructions:
1. Carefully read all the provided project files.
2. Extract the relevant information for each README section.
3. Organize the information according to the specified structure.
4. Ensure you adhere to these GitHub README best practices:
   - Use clear and concise language
   - Include a table of contents for longer READMEs
   - Use proper Markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)
   - Provide clear instructions for setting up and running the project
   - Include badges where appropriate (e.g., build status, version, license)
   - Link to additional documentation if available
5. Double-check that you have included all significant information from the input files.

Before writing the final README, wrap your analysis inside <readme_planning> tags in a thought block. In this section:
- List the key information from each input file separately (PRD, tech stack, dependencies).
- Create a brief outline for each README section.
- Note any missing information that might be needed for a comprehensive README.

This process will help ensure an accurate and well-organized README.

After completing the analysis, provide the full content of README.md in Markdown format.

Remember to strictly follow the given structure and include all contextual information from the provided files. Your goal is to create a README that not only adheres to the specified format but also delivers thorough and helpful information to anyone accessing the repository.

The final output should be solely the creation of a README.md file at the root of the project, in Markdown format in English, and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the readme_planning section.
