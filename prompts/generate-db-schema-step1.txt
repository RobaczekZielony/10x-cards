You are an AI assistant tasked with helping to plan a PostgreSQL database schema for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) based on the provided information. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in subsequent prompting to create the database schema, relationships, and row-level security (RLS) policies.

Please review the following information carefully:

<product_requirements>
@prd
</product_requirements>

<tech_stack>
@tech-stack
</tech_stack>

Analyze the provided information, focusing on aspects relevant to database design. Consider the following:

1. Identify key entities and their attributes based on the product requirements.
2. Determine potential relationships between entities.
3. Consider the data types and constraints that may be necessary.
4. Think about scalability and performance impact.
5. Evaluate security requirements and their implications for database design.
6. Consider specific PostgreSQL features that could be beneficial for the project.

Based on your analysis, generate a list of questions and recommendations. These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective database schema. Consider questions concerning:

1. Entity relationships and cardinality
2. Data types and constraints
3. Indexing strategies
4. Partitioning (if applicable)
5. Row-level security requirements
6. Performance considerations
7. Scalability concerns
8. Data integrity and consistency

The output should have the following structure:

<database_planning_output>
<questions>
[List your questions here, numbered]
</questions>

<recommendations>
[List your recommendations here, numbered]
</recommendations>
</database_planning_output>

Remember that your goal is to provide a comprehensive list of questions and recommendations that will assist in creating a robust PostgreSQL database schema for an MVP. Focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy in your output. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Continue this process by generating new questions and recommendations based on the given context and the user's responses until the user explicitly requests a summary.
