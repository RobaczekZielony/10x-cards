# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – 10x-cards

## 1. Product Overview
The 10x-cards project aims to enable users to quickly create and manage sets of educational flashcards. The application leverages LLM models (via API) to generate flashcard suggestions based on the provided text.

## 2. User Problem
Manually creating high-quality flashcards requires a significant investment of time and effort, which discourages the use of the effective spaced repetition learning method. The goal is to shorten the time needed to craft appropriate questions and answers and simplify the process of managing study material.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. Automatic Flashcard Generation:
   - The user pastes arbitrary text (e.g., a textbook excerpt).
   - The application sends the text to an LLM model via API.
   - The LLM model proposes a set of flashcards (questions and answers).
   - Flashcards are presented to the user in a list with options to accept, edit, or reject.

2. Manual Flashcard Creation and Management:
   - A form for manually creating flashcards (front and back sides).
   - Options to edit and delete existing flashcards.
   - Manual creation and display within the “My Flashcards” list view.

3. Basic Authentication and User Accounts:
   - Registration and login functionality.
   - Ability to delete an account and associated flashcards upon request.

4. Integration with Review Algorithm:
   - Provide a mechanism for scheduling flashcards for review (using an existing algorithm).
   - No additional metadata or advanced notification features in the MVP.

5. Storage and Scalability:
   - Flashcard and user data stored in a way that ensures scalability and security.

6. Flashcard Generation Statistics:
   - Collect information on how many flashcards were generated by AI and how many were ultimately accepted by the user.

7. Legal Requirements and Constraints:
   - User personal data and flashcards stored in compliance with GDPR.
   - Right to access and delete data (account and flashcards) upon user request.

## 4. Product Scope
### Out of Scope for MVP:
- Advanced, custom review algorithm (we will use an existing open-source library).
- Gamification mechanisms.
- Mobile applications (currently web only).
- Importing multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- Publicly available API.
- Sharing flashcards between users.
- Advanced notification system.
- Sophisticated flashcard keyword search.

## 5. User Stories

**ID: US-001**
**Title:** Account Registration
**Description:** As a new user, I want to register so that I can access my flashcards and use AI-powered generation.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The registration form includes fields for email and password.
- After valid submission and data verification, the account is activated.
- The user receives confirmation of successful registration and is logged in.

**ID: US-002**
**Title:** User Login
**Description:** As a registered user, I want to log in so that I can access my flashcards and generation history.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- With valid credentials, the user is redirected to the flashcard generation view.
- Invalid credentials display an error message about incorrect login data.
- Login data is stored securely.

**ID: US-003**
**Title:** AI-Powered Flashcard Generation
**Description:** As a logged-in user, I want to paste a snippet of text and generate flashcard suggestions via a button to save time on manual question-and-answer creation.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The generation view provides a text field for pasting content.
- The field accepts between 1,000 and 10,000 characters.
- Upon clicking the generate button, the app communicates with the LLM API and displays a list of suggested flashcards.
- If the API fails or returns no response, the user sees an appropriate error message.

**ID: US-004**
**Title:** Review and Approve Flashcard Suggestions
**Description:** As a logged-in user, I want to review generated flashcards and choose which ones to add to my set so that I keep only the most useful questions and answers.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The list of generated flashcards appears below the generation form.
- Each flashcard includes buttons to accept, edit, or reject it.
- After selecting flashcards, the user can click save to add them to the database.

**ID: US-005**
**Title:** Edit Flashcards (Manual and AI-Generated)
**Description:** As a logged-in user, I want to edit both manually created and AI-generated flashcards to correct mistakes or tailor them to my needs.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A list of saved flashcards is available (both manual and accepted AI-generated).
- Each flashcard can be opened in edit mode.
- Changes are saved to the database upon confirmation.

**ID: US-006**
**Title:** Delete Flashcards
**Description:** As a logged-in user, I want to delete unnecessary flashcards to keep my collection organized.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each flashcard in the “My Flashcards” view has a delete option.
- Deletion requires user confirmation before permanent removal.
- Flashcards are permanently removed from the database after confirmation.

**ID: US-007**
**Title:** Manual Flashcard Creation
**Description:** As a logged-in user, I want to manually create a flashcard (specifying front and back) to add my own material that is not AI-generated.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The “My Flashcards” view includes a button to add a new flashcard.
- Clicking the button opens a form with “Front” and “Back” fields.
- Upon saving, the new flashcard appears in the list.

**ID: US-008**
**Title:** Study Session with Review Algorithm
**Description:** As a logged-in user, I want my added flashcards to be available in a “Study Session” view powered by an external algorithm so I can study efficiently (spaced repetition).
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- In the “Study Session” view, the algorithm prepares a session of flashcards.
- The front of the card is shown first; the user then reveals the back through interaction.
- The user rates their recall according to the algorithm's guidelines.
- The algorithm then presents the next card in the session.

**ID: US-009**
**Title:** Secure Access and Authorization
**Description:** As a logged-in user, I want assurance that my flashcards are not accessible by others to maintain privacy and security.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only the logged-in user can view, edit, and delete their flashcards.
- No access to other users' flashcards or sharing capabilities.

## 6. Success Metrics
1. Flashcard Generation Efficiency:
   - 75% of AI-generated flashcards are accepted by users.
   - At least 75% of new flashcards are created using AI (relative to all newly added flashcards).

2. Engagement:
   - Track the number of generated flashcards versus accepted ones to assess quality and usefulness.
